## Description
I have developed an e-commerce website using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The website features user authentication, product browsing, category management, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing. It also includes a responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices.
## Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely.

- Product Catalog: Display products with details such as descriptions, prices, and images. Organize products into categories and subcategories for easier navigation.

- Shopping Cart: Enable users to add/remove items, view cart contents, and adjust quantities before checkout.

- Product Search: Implement a search functionality to help users quickly find products based on keywords or filters.

- Order Management: Enable users to view order history, track order status, and manage returns or cancellations if applicable.

- Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with secure payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to facilitate smooth and safe transactions.

- Security: Ensure the website is secure (HTTPS, data encryption) to protect user information and transactions.

- Responsive Design: Optimize the website for mobile devices as well as desktops, providing a seamless shopping experience across all platforms.
  
- Admin Dashboard: Provide administrators with tools to manage inventory, view orders, analyze sales data, and customize the website.
